# BatchKit Framework
This project was built to be an easy and fast forward builder for simple projects as way to keep it clean and organized. Without any IDE or complex (huge and with lots of unnecessary imports).  
<br>
The principal motivation to create this project was because I didn't want to use a huge package manager with a lot of features which make it slower.  
<br>
Since this is not the most performatic tool, still was a great sandbox to learn a bit about batch files and have an own package manager/compiler caller.
